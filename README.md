This project is a web-based application developed using Streamlit, designed to let users upload video files, ask questions about the video content, and receive AI-generated summaries. It also includes a translation feature to support multilingual users.
<br/>

🔧 Technologies and Libraries Used:
phi: Utilized to import the AI Agent framework, the Google Gemini model, and the DuckDuckGo web search tool for enhancing contextual responses.

google.generativeai: Used for functions like upload_file and get_file to process video files through Gemini's API.

deep_translator: Used to incorporate GoogleTranslator for translating the AI-generated summaries into various languages.

Google AI Studio: Used to generate the Gemini API key, which powers the core AI functionalities of the app.

<br/>
This is a simple, beginner-level project built as my first attempt at developing an Agentic AI application. I found the process incredibly insightful and enjoyable — and I’m excited to continue building more complex, visually appealing, and impactful AI-powered applications in the future!
