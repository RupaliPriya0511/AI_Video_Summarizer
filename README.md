🎥 AI Video Summarizer
Welcome to the Agentic AI Video Summarizer — a powerful, easy-to-use web application built with Streamlit and Google Gemini that allows you to:

✅ Upload long videos
✅ Ask meaningful questions about them
✅ Get summarized answers
✅ Translate results into your preferred language



🔧 Technologies and Libraries Used:

phi: Utilized to import the AI Agent framework, the Google Gemini model, and the DuckDuckGo web search tool for enhancing contextual responses.

google.generativeai: Used for functions like upload_file and get_file to process video files through Gemini's API.

deep_translator: Used to incorporate GoogleTranslator for translating the AI-generated summaries into various languages.

Google AI Studio: Used to generate the Gemini API key, which powers the core AI functionalities of the app.

This is a simple, beginner-level project built as my first attempt at developing an Agentic AI application. I found the process incredibly insightful and enjoyable — and I’m excited to continue building more complex, visually appealing, and impactful AI-powered applications in the future!
